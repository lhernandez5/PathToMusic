# PathToMusic

We created a friendly website for users to be able to search for their favorite artist or by city and state to provide a list of shows. If the user enters the artist, it will provide a list of shows around the country. If the user enters the City and State, it will provide a list of shows in that certain area. With the user entering an artist the page will provide a list of YouTube links for the user to visit. There is also a Trending Artists card for the user to see what other artists users are searching for.
