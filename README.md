This is an application that allows users to search for their favorite by artist or by city and state. After the user's input the application provides a list of shows. If the user enters the artist, it will provide a list of shows in the US. If the user enters the City and State, it will provide a list of shows in that certain area. Also searches provide a list of YouTube links for the user to visit. There is also a Trending Artists card for the user to see what other artists users are searching for.
